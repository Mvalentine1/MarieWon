<h1>Dreaming</h1>
        <p>
Growing up I always wanted to be able to experience a safari in the wildlife. By the time
you are 8 years old you have already been to every zoo in your county or city. As I search online 
I seen how these animals have the oppertunity to still live in the wild life. What they call home.
</p>
<h1> Do you want to visit the safari?
</h1>
<p>
    I know you would like to visit the safari. You have the oppertunity to see these animal in there home. Have a tour guide and a chef. The prices are pretty high.
    However, it is up to you if you will visit. I did my best to place a chart of my favorit animals and a link to check out ticket prices just incase you change
    your mind about visiting. As always, please make sure you conduct your own research before ordering tickets. The information found on this page is just being
    used for a project.
